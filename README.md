DC Wards 7-8 Data Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and understand the socio-economic conditions prevailing in Wards 7 and 8 of Washington D.C. These wards have been historically disadvantaged, with high crime rates and socio-economic disparities when compared to other wards. Our goal is to identify the key factors that contribute to this disparity and propose a solution.

The project is structured in three main steps:

Data Collection: We scraped data from various sources including government websites, databases, and binary files. Some data entry was required to create XML files from Excel, which were then used in the project.

Data Processing & Visualization: The XML or CSV files were ingested into a Python environment where we cleaned and processed the data. We then used this data to create visualizations for easier understanding and interpretation of the patterns and trends. The Python code and data cleaning processes are done using Jupyter notebooks for easy debugging and streamlining of processes.

Solution Proposal: Based on the data visualizations, we created a PowerPoint presentation proposing an online educational service designed to provide career opportunities within the communities. This part of the project is not included in the repository.

Key Findings
The data showed a stark disparity between Wards 1-6 and Wards 7-8. While the former are continually improving, the latter seem to be in a standstill. This is evident from the high crime rates and the significant differences in transportation choices across DC. Our proposal aims to address these issues by fostering safer career opportunities that can be accessed from within the communities.

Criticisms & Future Directions
Upon reflection, there are areas of the project that could have been approached differently. We believe that the choice of models for data analysis might not have been ideal and a cross-sectional study of certain metrics like health, income by industry/location, and others could have provided more insightful visualizations. Also, the solution, while beneficial to the individuals, may not directly contribute to strengthening or revitalizing the community. Future work on this project could focus on these areas for a more comprehensive analysis and impactful solution.

How to Use This Repository
This repository contains all the Python code and data files used in the project. You can clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis and visualizations. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
